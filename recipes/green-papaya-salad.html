    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 ½ cups julienned green papaya, soak in ice water for 10-15 minutes
        until they are firmer (See video @1:20 on how to julienne green papaya)
        2 cloves garlic
      </li>
      <li>Thai chilies, to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped,</li>
      <li>2-3 long beans, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp roasted peanuts (see note)</li>
      <li>
        1 heaping tablespoon small dried shrimp, roughly chop if you have large
        ones
      </li>
      <li>2 Tbsp fresh lime juice (see note)</li>
      <li>2 tsp tamarind paste (what is tamarind?)</li>
      <li>1 ½ Tbsp fish sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup grape tomato halves or a small tomato cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>
      Serving suggestion: sticky rice and BBQ chicken are classic pairings with
      papaya salad! Notes: I prefer buying raw peanuts and roasting them myself
      for the best flavour. Simply put them in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 15-18
      minutes until they're golden, stirring them half way through for even
      roasting. Keep leftover roasted peanuts in the fridge or freezer to keep
      them fresher longer. See video for the Thai way of cutting lime. If you
      have a big juicy lime, 2 tablespoon of juice is about ⅔ of the lime (so if
      you cut the lime the way I did in the video, you'll only need to juice
      piece #1 and #2). If your lime is small or doesn't have much juice, use
      the whole lime. You can always measure out the lime juice before adding to
      be sure.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of
        paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as little water on
        the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are
        no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet paste
        and all the chunks are dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.</li>
      <li>
        Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add fish sauce, tamarind paste, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime
        skin into the mortar as well for extra lime fragrance. Stir with a
      </li>
      <li>large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.</li>
      <li>
        Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip
        method as shown in the video @8:40. Once everything looks well mixed and
        the tomatoes are just slightly crushed, it's done!
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts (I forgot to do this in
        the video!).
      </li>
      <li>
        For a truly classic Northeastern Thai meal, serve with sticky rice and
        the ultimate BBQ chicken
      </li>
    </ol>
