  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ol>
    <h5>Cake</h5>
    <li>With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F). Butter a 20-cm (8-inch) springform
      pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In another bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually
      add 125 ml (1/2 cup) of the sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a third bowl, beat the remaining sugar, the butter, egg yolks, and vanilla with an electric mixer. At low
      speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Stir a quarter of the meringue into the batter to lighten it. With a spatula, gently fold in the remaining
      meringue. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake for about 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Unmould
      immediately and let completely cool on a wire rack</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>

    <h5>Vanilla Strawberries</h5>
    <li>plit the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. With the tip of a knife, remove the seeds from the vanilla pod.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar, vanilla seeds, and pod. Allow to macerate for about 15 minutes.
      Drain. Remove the pod. Set aside.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, whip the cream, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Assembly</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the cake in half horizontally to make two slices. Spread 250 ml (1 cup) of the whipped cream on the cut side
      of each slice. Scatter the drained vanilla strawberries on the whipped cream of a slice of cake. Cover with the
      other slice of cake, whipped cream side down. Garnish the top of the cake with the remaining whipped cream.
