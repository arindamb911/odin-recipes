    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 bags of black tea or 3 tablespoons loose-leaf black tea</li>
      <li>4 cups hot water</li>
      <li>3/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca pearls</li>
      <li>whole milk to serve, or your choice of milk</li>
      <li>simple syrup to serve, or your choice of sweetener</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the Simple Syrup (see note 1)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the tea: Steep the tea bags or leaves with 4 cups of freshly
        boiled water. Let the tea sit in water until it cools completely. (See
        note 2)
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the simple syrup (if using): Add the water and sugar to a
        saucepan and quickly stir everything together. Heat the water on
        medium-high and cook until the water boils and the sugar completely
        dissolves. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the simple syrup cool
        before transferring to a jar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the tapioca pearls: Bring about 4 cups of water to boil and add the
        tapioca pearls. Stir the pearls and wait for them to float to the top.
        Then, cook them for another 5 minutes. Test a pearl to see if it has
        reached the desired level of softness. Cook the pearls for another few
        minutes if they are still stiff. Use a slotted spoon to remove the
        pearls from the hot water. Quickly rinse the pearls with water. Transfer
        the pearls into a bowl, and mix the pearls with a few tablespoons of
        simple syrup (to taste).
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the drinks: Strain the tea into a pitcher. Divide the cooked
        tapioca pearls into 4 large glasses. Next, add a few ice cubes to each
        glass. Pour 1 cup of the tea into each glass. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of
        milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of simple syrup into each glass. Stir and
        taste the milk tea. Add more milk or simple syrup to your taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are serving the beverage to guests, have a small pitcher of milk
        and the jar of simple syrup ready so that each guest can adjust their
        drinks to their taste. The drink is usually served with large boba
        straws (large enough for the tapioca pearls to go through). If you don’t
        have the straws on hand, you can use spoons to scoop out the tapioca
        pearls.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Notes</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You will likely have some simple syrup left over, which you can
        refrigerate for 3 to 4 weeks. You can use any kind of sugar to make
        simple syrup, such as light or dark brown sugar or coconut sugar. I also
        like to infuse my syrup with ginger by adding a few slices of ginger to
        the saucepan as I make the syrup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Typically, I leave the tea steeping the entire time so that the tea is
        strong and bitter. Otherwise, I find that the tea flavor is too faint
        when I add milk and ice cubes to the drink. Some tea leaves definitely
        have a stronger bitter flavor. Feel free to remove the tea bags or tea
        leaves after 5 minutes if you are concerned about the bitterness of the
        tea.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are making the pearls about an hour ahead, don’t drain the pearls
        from the saucepan. Leave them in the hot water as the heat of the water
        will help keep the tapioca pearls soft.
